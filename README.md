# CSE499A-B-SENIOR-DESIGN-I-SENIOR-DESIGN-II
I developed an autonomous garbage collector robot based on embedded digital image processing (Senior Design Project) ➢ Developed a dataset of locally available garbage materials to train the algorithm ➢ Trained a Single Shot Detection (SSD) algorithm using the collected dataset ➢ Implemented the developed dataset into the Raspberry Pi, which automatically categorized them as Plastic, Paper, Glass, and Metal ➢ Wrote a python program to calculate the exact distance between the garbage and the robot using sonar sensors and move the robot towards the garbage using Toyota Denso motors ➢ Built a robotic arm structure using servo motors and plastic materials to collect the garbage
